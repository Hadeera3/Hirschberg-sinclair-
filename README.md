# Hirschberg-sinclair-

In order to execute this program, first install the RMI plugin for Eclipse at http://www.genady.net/rmi/v20/.
Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is a Java API that allows a Java program to invoke methods on an object that is running on a different Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In order to use RMI, a programmer needs to set up a special environment and configure the compiler.
We downloaded a special tool called a "RMI plug-in for eclipse." This tool automates the process of setting up the environment and configuring the compiler for RMI, and it can generate a registry (a special server that keeps track of RMI objects) with just a few clicks.
We then created a new Java project and divided it into two packages called "client" and "server." The files in these two packages are able to communicate with each other using RMI.


The Hirschberg–Sinclair algorithm can be used for leader election in a synchronous ring network.
The steps for the Hirschberg–Sinclair algorithm for a leader election in a synchronous ring network are:
1.	Each node in the network is assigned a unique identifier (ID).
2.	The nodes are organized into a ring, with each node connected to two neighbors.
3.	The nodes begin the leader election process by sending their IDs to their right neighbor.
4.	When a node receives an ID from its left neighbor, it compares the ID to its own. If the received ID is greater, the node passes the received ID onto its right neighbor and continues to listen for IDs. If the received ID is less than or equal to the node's own ID, the node assumes the role of leader and sends a "stop" message to its neighbors.
5.	The process continues until a "stop" message is received by a node, at which point the leader election process is complete and the node with the highest ID is elected as the leader.
